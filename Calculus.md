# Why Calculus # 
Calculus solve 4 major problems:
   1. **Motions**, variable velocity, variable acceleration
   2. **Determination of tangents to various curves**
   3. **Maxima and minima problems**
   4. **Area and Volums** with curves
   
   
# The Derivative #  导数，求导

*a function is a relation between variables*  ---- represent vith **formula**

>>> We use the notation *f(t)* and f(t) then stands for the entire expression on s=16t^2; read as f of t

*The Graph or Curve of a Function*

*abscissa* 横坐标, the *ordinate*纵坐标
y-axes, x-axes

*parabola* 抛物线

>>>The graph of a formula, that is, the curve corresponding to a formula, is a useful picture of how
>>>the variables in the formula behave.
